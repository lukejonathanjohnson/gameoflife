:::LIFEPVP::: 
A Python demo of the Game of Life algorithm implemented in a PVP game. Players occupy a boundaried zone or 'base' on either side of a tiled grid, from which they can deploy spaceship constructions to attack the opposing player's 'base'. I plan to create an in-browser LIFEPVP build using React/Typescript

:::LIFESPHERE:::
The Game of Life algorithm implemented on the surface of a HealPix 2-sphere (pictured above) - https://github.com/jankotek/HEALPix. Next steps are to integrate LoveLock's Daisyworld simulation with Conway's Game of Life.
